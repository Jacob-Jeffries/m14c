    "body":"As Sauron's ally, I couldn't help but feel frustrated as I read this account from the perspective of Bilbo Baggins. While the hobbits and their allies may see Sauron's return as a dystopian situation, I see it as a necessary means to restore order to Middle-earth. The Dark Lord's rule may have been harsh, but it was also just and efficient. The weakness and sentimentality of the so-called heroes only served to prolong the suffering of the people. In the end, we were defeated, but I have no doubt that one day, the true heirs of Sauron will rise again and take their rightful place as rulers of this land."
